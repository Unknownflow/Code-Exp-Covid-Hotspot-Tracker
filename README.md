# Project: Covid Hotspot Tracker

This project was created for the Brainhack 2021, Code_EXP hackathon. Our project idea was to create a mobile application to detect the possible Covid-19 Hotspots in Singapore and display it in a Expo mobile application. In 2021, Covid-19 was still widespread across Singapore and the world and we hoped to alert the public of the locations where Covid-19 is likely to spread, thus reducing the likelihood of the public contracting Covid-19 and falling ill as a result.
Although my team and I did not win in the end, nonetheless, it was an eye-opening experience as it was the first time my team and I had created a mobile application from scratch. 

Team members:
